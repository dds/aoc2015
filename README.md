# Advent of Code 2020 (Golang)

This repository is my solutions to [Advent of Code, 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Prerequisites

### Golang

If you don't have Golang installed, I recommend installing [`brew` ](https://brew.sh/) and running `brew install go`.

## Running the Solutions

Run the solutions directly from the code on GitHub by running e.g. the solution for day 1:

```sh
go run github.com/dds/aoc2020/day1
```

If you download or clone this repository, run the code locally with

```sh
go run ./day1
```
